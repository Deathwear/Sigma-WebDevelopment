<!--                         [SPECIFICITY]
    CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are overlapping or multiple CSS rules.

     
    The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS (user agent stylesheet)
    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type [!important]

    So, the order of specificity is:
    Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector



    To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
    Universal Selector: 0
    Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
    Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
    ID selectors: 100
    Inline styles: 1000
