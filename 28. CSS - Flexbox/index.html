    => flexbox items are not from left to right, instead they are in flex direction.
    => There are two axis: main axis and cross axis 
    justify-content: center; makes it center from the main axis irrespective of horizontal and vertical direction
    => flex-wrap will wrap the content to the next line so that content will not get hidden or overflow.
    => align-content: center; will align more two line in center
    => There is no justify-item in flexbox
    => wrap-reverse will wrap it reverse 
    
    =>flex-flow: "direction" "property"
    for eg: 
        flex-flow: row wrap-reverse;
        (it will make its content execute its property with its given direction i.e., in its row/column direction)

         (there are some property for items also)like:

         gap:40px; (gap can be defined for row & column independently)

                            ```[FLEXBOX]```
        

        FlexBox aka Flexible Box Layout makes it easier to layout, align and style items in the container while maintaining the responsiveness of the website.
        To create a flexbox you need to set the display of the container as flex
        Eg: {display: flex;}



                            ```{Flex Container Properties}```

        1. Flex Direction   (decides the direction of the items i.e., row/column wise)
        2. Flex Wrap  (wrap the contents into many lines i.e., preventing it from overflow/ hiding)
        3. Justify Content (aligns through main axis generall horizontal when direction is row, not column)
        4. Align Items    (aligns the single line)
        5. Align Content  (aligns the all lines when wrap is enabled)
        6. Gap: "row" "col";



                            ```{Flex Items Properties}```
        1. Order: "value"(1/2/3/4 etc) ( sets the order in which the flex items are shown.)
        2. Flex Grow & Shrink  (Decides the relative size of flex items. By default, this property is zero)  e.g: flex-grow: 3; (make its size triple to the other boxes)
        3. Align Self (This property allows default alignment to be overridden for the individual flex items)  for-e.g: align-self: end; (will make this box at the end of the flex while other are at their decided position)
