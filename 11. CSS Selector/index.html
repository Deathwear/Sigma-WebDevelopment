  <!-- 
                  [Pseudo Elements]
        Elements can be inserted dynamically through CSS.
        for Eg:
            .box::before{
                content: "Aamir is good";
            }

            (this wiil be written on the website before the box class similary we can use after property)
   -->

   <!-- 
        ::selection is used for selected elements
        for eg:
                .box::selection{
                    color: aqua;
                }
            (it works when we select these item)
    -->

    <!-- 
        targeting placeholder
        for eg:
        input::placeholder{
            color: blue;
        }
        (this will convert the text color/ size / font whatever of the placeholder into whaterver we want)
     -->
